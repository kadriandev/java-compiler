This directory contains an input file "newsdata.txt" that can be used to test
your implementation for the Warmup Assignment.  A sample output file
"sample.out" is also given for the beginning portion of "newsdata.txt".
Finally, a sample scanner for a tiny programming language is given so that
you can follow a similar code structure for your implementation. As stated
in the assignment description, you are allowed to use/adapt it for your
implementation; just acknowledge it in the README file of your submission.
